# agent-shell-dispatch

Multi-agent dispatch and coordination for [agent-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell). Spawn parallel AI agents from Emacs, coordinate their work, and visualize progress with a live SVG task graph rendered in the agent-shell header.

## Features

- **Live SVG task graph** -- dependency-aware DAG rendered in the header line with status colors and state indicators
- **Explicit status model** -- tasks are `not-started`, `working`, `done`, `error`, `permission`, or `dead`, driven entirely by explicit reports (no process-state guessing)
- **Parallel agent spawning** -- launch background agent-shell sessions that work independently
- **Subagent tracking** -- Claude Code subagents (the Agent tool) launched by the dispatcher appear as graph nodes automatically, with live status and no report calls
- **Permission forwarding** -- tool permission requests from background agents show as a lock icon in the SVG header; the native permission UI appears in the subagent's own buffer by default (optionally rendered in the dispatcher via `agent-shell-dispatch-msg-show-permissions-in-dispatcher`)
- **Inter-agent messaging** -- typed message protocol for progress reports, error reports, input requests, and completion notifications
- **Dispatcher pattern** -- the primary agent coordinates without implementing; subagents communicate via messages only, and the dispatcher owns all task graph updates
- **Agent activity tracker** -- a compact column on the left of the task graph shows each agent's busy/idle state in real-time, auto-wrapping to multiple columns when needed
- **Session mode propagation** -- when you change the dispatcher's session mode (e.g. plan → acceptEdits), the change is automatically forwarded to all subagent sessions so their permission behavior stays in sync

## Task States

| State | Icon | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `not-started` | `·` | No report yet -- task hasn't been picked up |
| `working` | spinner | Agent explicitly reported working |
| `done` | `✓` | Dispatcher marked task complete |
| `error` | `✗` | Dispatcher marked task as errored |
| `permission` | lock | Working task blocked on a permission or input request |
| `dead` | `?` | Agent reported working but process died |

## Installation

### use-package (with straight or elpaca)

```elisp
(use-package agent-shell-dispatch
  :after agent-shell
  :config
  (agent-shell-dispatch-global-mode 1))
```

### Manual

Clone this repository and add it to your `load-path`:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/agent-shell-dispatch")
(require 'agent-shell-dispatch)
(agent-shell-dispatch-global-mode 1)
```

### Global render mode

`agent-shell-dispatch-global-mode` installs advice for header rendering, message queue draining, session mode propagation, and a theme change hook. All are no-ops in buffers without active dispatch state (all state is buffer-local), so it's safe to enable unconditionally. Without it, the task graph won't render and session mode changes won't propagate to subagents.

## Requirements

- Emacs 29+ (for SVG support and `text-property-search-forward`)
- [agent-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell)

## Usage

This package is designed to be driven by an AI agent (e.g. Claude Code) via the included **dispatch skill**. The typical workflow:

1. Symlink the skills into your agent's skills directory
2. (Optional) Add a hook to redirect `TodoWrite` to the task graph
3. Invoke `/dispatch` with a plan or description

### 1. Install the skills

Symlink the skills into your Claude Code skills directory (or equivalent for your agent):

```sh
# Required -- multi-agent dispatch coordinator
ln -s /path/to/agent-shell-dispatch/skills/dispatch ~/.claude/skills/dispatch

# Optional -- replaces TodoWrite with the SVG task graph for single-agent work
ln -s /path/to/agent-shell-dispatch/skills/tasks ~/.claude/skills/tasks
```

The **tasks** skill renders the same live SVG task graph used by dispatch, but for single-agent workflows. When installed, the agent uses it in place of `TodoWrite` to visually track progress through multi-step work.

After symlinking, restart or reload your agent so it picks up the new skills.

### 2. (Optional) Block TodoWrite via hook

If you installed the tasks skill and want to ensure the agent never falls back to `TodoWrite`, add a `PreToolUse` hook to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "TodoWrite",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo '{\"hookSpecificOutput\":{\"hookEventName\":\"PreToolUse\",\"permissionDecision\":\"deny\",\"permissionDecisionReason\":\"BLOCKED: Do not use TodoWrite. Use the tasks skill instead (invoke via Skill tool with skill=tasks). This is a hard override — no exceptions.\"}}'",
            "statusMessage": "Checking TodoWrite override..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Run a dispatch

In your agent session, invoke:

```
/dispatch PLAN-OR-DESCRIPTION
```

The agent becomes the dispatcher: it spawns implementation agents, assigns tasks, and starts the live task graph in the header. Permission requests from background agents appear as interactive buttons in the dispatcher buffer.

#### Dispatch flow

1. **Dispatcher assigns tasks** to subagents and marks them `working`
2. **Subagents work** and communicate via messages only (they never touch the task graph)
3. **Subagent finishes** and sends a `task-completed` message with task ID and summary
4. **Dispatcher receives notification**, optionally sends a reviewer, then marks the task `done`
5. **On error**, subagent sends an `error` message; dispatcher marks `error`

The dispatcher owns all task graph transitions. Subagents cannot call `agent-shell-dispatch-report` or `agent-shell-dispatch-start`.

#### Subagents vs. spawned sessions

There are two ways to run work in parallel:

| | Claude Code subagent (Agent tool) | Spawned session (`agent-shell-dispatch-spawn-agent`) |
|---|---|---|
| Started by | The model, from inside the dispatcher's session | Emacs or the model, via elisp |
| Runs in | The dispatcher's own claude-code-acp session | Its own `[agent:NAME]` buffer and process |
| Status in the graph | Automatic, from the tool call's status | Explicit `agent-shell-dispatch-report` calls |
| Steerable mid-task | No | Yes (`agent-shell-dispatch-send-to-agent`, or type in its buffer) |
| Good for | Short, fire-and-forget work such as wayfinder "Research: ..." questions | Ticket work, `start-ticket`, and the auto-start cascade |

While a graph is active, every Agent tool call in the dispatcher buffer becomes a node, named after the call's `description`. The node shows `working` while the call is pending or in progress, `done` when it completes and `error` if it fails. Other tool calls are ignored. If the description or prompt names a ticket that is already in the graph, the status goes to that ticket instead of a new node. A ticket counts as named when the text says `ticket 3`, `ticket #3` or `#3`, or contains its local file name (`03-slug`). Bare numbers don't count.

Background subagents (`run_in_background`) are tracked until they finish. claude-agent-acp completes their tool call as soon as they launch, but it holds the dispatcher's turn open until they drain. The node therefore stays `working` until the dispatcher's turn completes, then becomes `done`. The one limitation is that a background subagent which fails after launching still shows as `done`, because no failure status reaches Emacs.

Set `agent-shell-dispatch-track-subagents` to `nil` to turn tracking off. The setting takes effect at the next `agent-shell-dispatch-start`.

### 4. (Optional) Wayfinder integration

If you use Matt Pocock's [wayfinder](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) skill, the `agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder.el` bridge renders wayfinder efforts as live SVG task graphs. Tickets become nodes, `Blocked by:` lines become dependency edges, and status transitions (claimed/resolved) animate in real time.

Two tracker backends are supported:

| Backend | Ticket source | Blocking convention | Load call |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|
| `local` (default) | `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-slug.md` | `Blocked by: NN, NN` line in file | `(agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-load "<effort>")` |
| `github` | GitHub Issues with `wayfinder:*` labels | `Blocked by: #N, #N` line in issue body | `(agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-load "<effort>" :backend 'github)` |

Add the following to your global `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md`) so the wayfinder skill knows to call the dispatch hooks:

```markdown
## agent-shell-dispatch — Wayfinder integration

When running `/wayfinder`, evaluate these elisp hooks at the specified lifecycle
points to keep the SVG task graph in sync:

### Local markdown tracker (default)

| Wayfinder lifecycle point | Elisp to evaluate |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Chart — after tickets created and wired (step 4) | `(progn (require 'agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder) (agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-load "<effort-slug>"))` |
| Chart — fire research subagents (step 5) | `(agent-shell-dispatch-spawn-agent default-directory "<ticket-slug>" "Research: <question>")` |
| Work-through — after claiming (step 2) | `(agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-refresh)` |
| Work-through — after resolving (step 4) | `(agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-refresh)` |
| Work-through — after creating/graduating tickets (step 5) | `(agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-refresh)` |
| Session end | `(agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-unload)` |

### GitHub Issues tracker

| Wayfinder lifecycle point | Elisp to evaluate |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Chart — after tickets created and wired (step 4) | `(progn (require 'agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder) (agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-load "<effort-slug>" :backend 'github))` |
| Chart — fire research subagents (step 5) | `(agent-shell-dispatch-spawn-agent default-directory "<ticket-slug>" "Research: <question>")` |
| Work-through — after claiming (step 2) | `(agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-refresh)` |
| Work-through — after resolving (step 4) | `(agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-refresh)` |
| Work-through — after creating/graduating tickets (step 5) | `(agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-refresh)` |
| Session end | `(agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-unload)` |

Research subagents spawned via `agent-shell-dispatch-spawn-agent` appear in
the agent activity column. The graph grows incrementally as fog clears —
no restart needed.
```

The bridge handles:

- **Auto-start cascade** -- tickets whose blockers are all done start automatically (controlled by `agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-auto-start`, default `t`). On load, any ticket with no blockers starts immediately; as agents complete, newly unblocked tickets cascade through the graph
- **Fog of war** -- new tickets added by wayfinder appear as new nodes without restarting dispatch
- **Out of scope** -- tickets removed/closed by wayfinder disappear from the graph
- **Edge changes** -- updated `Blocked by:` lines re-route arrows
- **Backend-agnostic refresh** -- `agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder-refresh` uses whichever backend was set at load time

## Architecture

The package is split into five modules:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `agent-shell-dispatch.el` | Agent lifecycle, spawn/send/kill coordination, incremental graph mutation, global mode |
| `agent-shell-dispatch-state.el` | Core data structures (session state, agent info, status structs), pure status resolution, buffer-local state variables |
| `agent-shell-dispatch-messages.el` | Typed messaging protocol between sub-agents and dispatcher (permissions, progress, errors, input requests, completions) |
| `agent-shell-dispatch-render.el` | Pure SVG task-graph renderer -- topology, geometry, theme-aware drawing, viewport panning |
| `agent-shell-dispatch-wayfinder.el` | Bridge between wayfinder efforts and the dispatch graph -- reads tickets from local markdown or GitHub Issues, maps blocking edges to DAG dependencies, incremental sync |

Module boundaries:

- **state** defines all structs (`agent-shell-dispatch-state`, `agent-shell-dispatch-agent-info`, `agent-shell-dispatch-reported-status`, `agent-shell-dispatch-resolved-status`) and owns status resolution logic. Pure -- no side effects beyond the hash table it's given.
- **render** is pure -- no knowledge of agents, processes, or dispatch lifecycle. It receives resolved task data and produces SVGs. The dispatcher injects callbacks via hook variables.
- **messages** owns the typed protocol and UI rendering for inter-agent communication. Permission forwarding, deferred queuing, and fragment management live here.
- **dispatch** owns agent lifecycle and wires state, render, and messages together. It manages subscriptions and exposes the public mutation API (`add-task`, `add-tasks`, `remove-task`, `report`).
- **wayfinder** is an optional bridge layer that maps external ticket state into dispatch primitives. It depends on dispatch but nothing depends on it.

All dispatch and render state is buffer-local, so multiple independent dispatch sessions can run concurrently in separate agent-shell buffers.
